# 💧 HydroWatch — Global Microplastics Monitor

**A community-powered app for tracking microplastic contamination in water sources worldwide.**

HydroWatch makes it easy for students, scientists, activists, and everyday people to test their local water, submit results, and see how their community compares to the rest of the world. Every data point helps build a clearer picture of the global microplastics crisis.

## 🌍 What It Does

- **Submit your water test results** — log particle counts from your own experiments using the density separation method
- **See a live global map** — color-coded hotspots showing contamination levels by location and safety rating
- **Compare water sources** — river, tap, filtered, bottled, and ocean water ranked by contamination
- **Track cleaning rates** — see which cities are most effectively filtering their water
- **Spread awareness** — shareable facts and social media tools built in

## 🔬 How to Test Your Water

HydroWatch is designed to work alongside a simple home or classroom experiment:

1. Collect a 90mL sample of your water source
2. Mix with a salt or sugar density separation solution
3. Filter through a 20-micron or finer filter
4. Let dry, then count particles under magnification
5. Submit your results to the global map!

Full protocol available inside the app under the **Research Planner** tab.

## 🧪 Safety Level Scale

HydroWatch uses a 5-tier safety rating based on particle count per 90mL sample:

| Level | Particles | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Minimal Risk | 0–5 | Comparable to distilled water |
| 🔵 Low Risk | 6–15 | Below average contamination |
| 🟡 Moderate Risk | 16–30 | Common in urban tap water |
| 🟠 Elevated Risk | 31–60 | Filter recommended |
| 🔴 Critical Risk | 60+ | Do not consume untreated |

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Anyone can contribute data! To appear on the global map:

1. Run a water test using the density separation method
2. Open the **Submit Data** tab
3. Enter your location, water source, particle count, and safety rating
4. Hit submit — your result appears on the map instantly

For the **Cleaning Rate leaderboard**, submit both a raw source reading AND a filtered reading from the same city.

## 🌊 About

HydroWatch was created to make the invisible visible — microplastics are everywhere, but most people never see them. By crowdsourcing water testing data from communities around the world, we can build the most comprehensive public map of microplastic contamination ever created.

**Every test matters. Every submission counts.**
