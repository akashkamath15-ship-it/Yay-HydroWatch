HydroWatch — Global Microplastics Monitor
A community-powered app for tracking microplastic contamination in water sources worldwide.
HydroWatch makes it easy for students, scientists, activists, and everyday people to test their local water, submit results, and see how their community compares to the rest of the world. Every data point helps build a clearer picture of the global microplastics crisis.

🌍 What It Does

Submit your water test results — log particle counts from your own experiments using the density separation method
See a live global map — color-coded hotspots showing contamination levels by location and safety rating
Compare water sources — river, tap, filtered, bottled, and ocean water ranked by contamination
Track cleaning rates — see which cities are most effectively filtering their water
Spread awareness — shareable facts and social media tools built in


🔬 How to Test Your Water
HydroWatch is designed to work alongside a simple home or classroom experiment:

Collect a 90mL sample of your water source
Mix with a salt or sugar density separation solution
Filter through a 20-micron or finer filter
Let dry, then count particles under magnification
Submit your results to the global map!

Full protocol available inside the app under the Research Planner tab.

🧪 Safety Level Scale
HydroWatch uses a 5-tier safety rating based on particle count per 90mL sample:
LevelParticlesMeaning🟢 Minimal Risk0–5Comparable to distilled water🔵 Low Risk6–15Below average contamination🟡 Moderate Risk16–30Common in urban tap water🟠 Elevated Risk31–60Filter recommended🔴 Critical Risk60+Do not consume untreated

🤝 How to Contribute
Anyone can contribute data! To appear on the global map:

Run a water test using the density separation method
Open the Submit Data tab
Enter your location, water source, particle count, and safety rating
Hit submit — your result appears on the map instantly

For the Cleaning Rate leaderboard, submit both a raw source reading AND a filtered reading from the same city.

📣 Spread the Word

🌊 About
HydroWatch was created to make the invisible visible — microplastics are everywhere, but most people never see them. By crowdsourcing water testing data from communities around the world, we can build the most comprehensive public map of microplastic contamination ever created.
Every test matters. Every submission counts.
